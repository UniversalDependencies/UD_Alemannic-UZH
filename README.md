# Summary


_UD\_Swiss\_German-UZH_ is a tiny manually annotated treebank of 100 sentences in different Swiss German dialects and a variety of text genres.



# Introduction

This repository presents work on Universal Dependency Parsing for Swiss German, which has been done as part of the Master’s Thesis _Parsing Approaches for Swiss German_ at the [Institute for Computational Linguistics](www.cl.uzh.ch) at the University of Zurich.

The provided resources consist of 100 Swiss German sentences, manually annotated with part-of-speech tags and universal dependencies.

[NOAH’s Corpus of Swiss German Dialects](https://noe-eva.github.io/NOAH-Corpus/corpus.html) was used as a resource for the Swiss German part-of-speech tagging process - a process preliminary to parsing.




# Acknowledgments

This work has been performed at the University of Zurich by Noëmi Aepli with the help of Simon Clematide.
